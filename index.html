            <h1 class="body-h1">Lord of the Rings</h1>
            <p class="body-p">The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. Set in Middle-earth, intended to be Earth at some distant time in the past, the story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's book The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.
                The title refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron, who in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power given to Men, Dwarves, and Elves, in his campaign to conquer all of Middle-earth. From homely beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the quest to destroy the One Ring mainly through the eyes of the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin.</p>

                    <p class="popup-text">
                        Barad-dûr was built by Sauron in the land of Mordor, not far from the volcano known as Mount Doom. 
                        The construction of the tower began around the SA 1000, and took six hundred years to complete. 
                        It was the greatest fortress built since the fall of Angband during the War of Wrath. 
                        Barad-dûr was besieged for seven years by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men during the Second Age, 
                        and was leveled after Sauron's defeat at the hands of Isildur. But because it was created using the power of the One Ring, 
                        its foundations could not be destroyed while the Ring itself still existed.
                        As Isildur failed to destroy the Ring, the tower was eventually re-built when 
                        Sauron returned to Mordor thousands of years later in TA 2942.

                        The fortress of the Tower of the Sun was built to guard against the Men of the White Mountains in the year Second Age 3320 by the Dúnedain of Gondor, 
                        those Faithful Númenóreans who escaped the destruction of Númenor the year prior. 
                        It was at that time named Minas Anor, meaning "Tower of the Sun". It served as the home of Anárion, as Minas Ithil, 
                        built to guard against Mordor, became the dwelling-place of Isildur. 
                        The South-kingdom, however, was jointly ruled from Osgiliath by both brothers under the overlordship of Elendil.

                        (The Wizard's Vale) in the Misty Mountains. Its location was at the northwestern corner of the Kingdom of Gondor, 
                        guarding the Fords of Isen from enemy incursions into Calenardhon and, together with the fortress of Aglarond to its south, 
                        protecting the Gap of Rohan.Isengard was comprised of a black, circular, stone-wall surrounding a broad plain, 
                        in the center of which was the Tower of Orthanc. Isengard had only one gate, which faced south.

                        Bree continued to thrive without any central authority or government for many centuries. 
                        Bree had become the most westerly settlement of men in all of Middle-earth by the time of the War of the Ring, and became one of only three or four inhabited settlements in all of Eriador. 
                        At the time of the War of the Ring, Bree-land was the only part of Middle-earth where Men and hobbits dwelt together. Being located on the most important crossroads in the north, 
                        on the crossing of the Great East Road and the Greenway, people would pass through Bree. The Prancing Pony had many rooms, but the local people did not seem accustomed to many travellers.

                        It was built with the power of the One Ring, like the Barad-dûr. 
                        After Sauron's fall in the War of the Last Alliance, it was garrisoned by the Men of Gondor, who raised the two great Towers of the Teeth, Narchost and Carchost,

                        However Elrond arrived too late and along with the refugees from Eregion was forced to retreat back to a valley which they made into a stronghold. This was the beginning of Rivendell. 
                        Sauron laid siege to it but with the arrival of the Númenóreans the besieging force was destroyed.

                        The King of the Mountains swore upon the stone an oath of loyalty and to fight against the enemies of Gondor when it was founded. 
                        When the time came, the Men of the Mountains broke their oath and would not fight against Sauron, for they had worshiped him before in the Dark Years. 
                        Isildur put a curse on them that they would never rest until they fulfilled this oath.
                        The hill appears to have been desolate at the end of the Third Age due to the terror of the Sleepless Dead when the heir of Isildur, 
                        Aragorn, came to Erech to hold them to their oath again. 
                        This time they held true to their oath and formed the Army of the Dead and helped Aragorn fight the Corsairs of Umbar at Pelargir.

            <h1 class="modal-h1">Fellowship of the Ring</h1>
            <p class="modal-p">
                The Fellowship of the Ring opens with a party for Bilbo’s 111th birthday. Bilbo gives his ring to his heir, his cousin Frodo Baggins. When the time comes to part with the ring, however, Bilbo becomes strangely reluctant to do so. He gives up the ring only at the determined urging of his friend, Gandalf the Grey, a great Wizard. Gandalf suspects that the ring is indeed the One Ring of legend. After confirming his suspicions, he tells Frodo that the Ring must be taken away from the Shire, as Sauron’s power is growing once again.
                Frodo sets out from the Shire with three of his Hobbit friends—Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Along the way, they are pursued by the nine Ringwraiths, servants of Sauron who take the form of terrifying Black Riders. The hobbits spend a night in the company of wandering Elves, who promise to send word ahead to friends who will protect the hobbits. Barely out of the Shire, the hobbits get lost in the Old Forest, where they have to be rescued from a malevolent willow tree, which swallows up Merry and Pippin, and then from an evil tomb ghost. The hobbits’ rescuer is Tom Bombadil, a strange, jovial entity with great powers who is the oldest creature in Middle-earth.
                The hobbits make it to the town of Bree, where they meet Aragorn, a Ranger who roams the wilderness and who is the heir of the Kings of the ancient Men of Westernesse. Those who do not know Aragorn’s true name call him Strider. Frodo tries to keep a low profile at the inn in Bree, but he ends up causing a scene when while taking part in a rollicking rendition of a song he falls, accidentally slips the Ring onto his finger, and vanishes.
                That night, Aragorn advises the hobbits not to sleep in their rooms at the inn. In doing so, he saves their lives—for the first of many times. A letter Gandalf left at the inn months before advises the group to head for Rivendell, a realm of the Elves. Aragorn sets out with the hobbits the next day, and with his help they avoid the Black Riders for some time. However, at the top of the hill Weathertop, the Company is forced to defend itself against the attacking Riders. Frodo is wounded during the skirmish.
                Frodo’s wound, made by a weapon of a servant of Sauron, plagues the hobbit as the Company makes its way eastward. Aragorn is greatly concerned about the power the wound might exert over Frodo. Near Rivendell they meet the Elf-lord Glorfindel, who has been out looking for them. At the last ford before Rivendell, Frodo, riding Glorfindel’s horse, outruns the ambushing Black Riders, who are swept away in a flood created by Elrond, the master of Rivendell.
                Elrond heals Frodo and then holds a meeting to discuss what to do about the Ring. During this Council, Frodo learns the full history of the Ring. Frodo accepts the burden of taking the Ring to the only place it can be destroyed—the place where it was forged. It promises to be a long, nearly impossible journey, as the Ring was forged in the Cracks of Doom, part of the fiery mountain Orodruin in the very heart of Sauron’s realm of Mordor.
                At the end of the meeting, the Council creates a group to help Frodo in his quest. In addition to Frodo, the Fellowship of the Ring includes Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, an Elf named Legolas, a Dwarf named Gimli, and a Man from the south named Boromir.
                The Fellowship heads south and attempts to pass over the Misty Mountains via the pass of Caradhras. Their way is blocked by snow and rock slides, and they are forced to divert their path through the Mines of Moria—the ancient, underground realm of the Dwarves. During the journey through Moria, Gandalf falls into the chasm of Khazad-dûm while protecting the Company from a Balrog, a terrible demon.
                The rest of the party continues on to Lórien, the forest of the Galadrim Elves, where the Lady Galadriel tests their hearts and gives them gifts to help them on the quest. Frodo, spellbound by Galadriel’s power and wisdom, offers her the Ring. She refuses, however, saying that, despite her intentions, the Ring would corrupt her; ultimately, she would only replace Sauron.
                Leaving Lórien, the Fellowship travels by boat down the Great River, Anduin. At night, they spot Gollum—a deformed creature that had once owned the Ring but then lost it to Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit—following them. When they reach the Falls of Rauros, the Fellowship must decide whether to head toward Mordor on the east or toward the safety of the city of Minas Tirith to the west.
                Boromir, overcome by the Ring’s power and desiring the Ring for himself, confronts Frodo. Frodo fends off Boromir and decides that he must go on to Mordor rather than to the safety of Minas Tirith. However, Frodo cannot bear the thought of imperiling his friends on the dangerous journey or allowing the Ring to corrupt them, so he attempts to leave secretly and continue the quest alone. Frodo does not, however, manage to elude Sam, so the two of them set out together for Mordor.

            <h1 class="modal-h1">The Twin Towers</h1>
            <p class="modal-p">
                The Two Towers opens with the disintegration of the Fellowship, as Merry and Pippin are taken captive by Orcs after the death of Boromir in battle. The Orcs, having heard a prophecy that a Hobbit will bear a Ring that gives universal power to its owner, wrongly think that Merry and Pippin are the Ring-bearers.
                Several other members of the Fellowship, including Gimli, Legolas, and Aragorn, resolve to pursue Merry and Pippin. They follow the hobbits’ tracks through fields and forests, always on the lookout for Orcs. The group encounters the Riders of Rohan, led by Éomer.
                Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin are being conveyed back to Orc headquarters when Orcs from another tribe, the Uruk-hai, kidnap them in pursuit of the Ring they believe the hobbits to be carrying. Pippin and Merry escape the Orcs and travel through the forest near the Entwash River, where an Ent (a giant treelike creature) named Fangorn befriends them. Fangorn offers the hobbits nourishment and conveys them to an Ent assembly. There, the Ents resolve to go to war against the Orcs of Isengard (creatures controlled by the corrupted wizard Saruman), who have been cruel to them.
                Meanwhile, Saruman haunts Aragorn and his group as they travel the forest. Gandalf then appears to them, reborn after his earlier death in The Fellowship of the Ring as Gandalf the White, also known as the White Rider. Gandalf guides Aragorn’s group to Edoras, the Golden Hall of King Théoden. There, Gandalf exposes Théoden’s counselor, Wormtongue, as a spy for the evil Saruman. Gandalf also facilitates a reunion between Théoden and Éomer.
                The group then proceeds to confront Saruman at Isengard, where they are surprised to find Merry and Pippin at the gates of Saruman’s headquarters. The hobbits tell Gandalf that the Ents wish to meet with him, to offer their aid in the struggle against Saruman. The group finds Wormtongue in Saruman’s tower, Orthanc. Wormtongue tries to kill Gandalf by throwing an object down on him from a window. That object is a palantír, a magic seeing-stone that transmits images. Pippin looks into the palantír, which allows the Dark Lord Sauron to discover where Pippin is and pursue him.
                The second half of The Two Towers rejoins Frodo and Sam just after they separate from the rest of the Fellowship and begin making their way to Mordor to destroy the Ring. As they travel, they meet the creature Gollum, whom they tame and force to be their guide to Mordor. Sam and Frodo are wary of Gollum—they know he owned the Ring before and wishes to regain it—but they desperately need someone to direct them to their destination.
                Frodo, Sam, and Gollum journey through a smelly marshland in which they can see the faces of slain warriors haunting the waters. They travel by night, as Gollum cannot stand the sun, so they are cold and hungry most of the time. They finally reach the Black Gate of the realm of Mordor and see Sauron’s Dark Tower rising overhead. The Gate is well guarded, and the hobbits wonder how they will be able to get inside. Gollum directs them to a different, hidden path into Mordor, where the guards will likely be sparser. On the way, the hobbits are frightened by dark shapes flying overhead—the Nazgûl, the Black Riders of Sauron who are searching for the Ring.
                Along the way, Frodo meets a band of Men led by Faramir, the younger brother of Boromir. The men are suspicious of the hobbits at first, believing they are responsible for Boromir’s death. Frodo avoids telling Faramir that his brother betrayed the Fellowship by attempting to seize the Ring for himself, but Sam blurts it out. Faramir is shocked, but grateful to learn the truth, so he offers support to the hobbits’ journey. Faramir’s men nearly kill Gollum, who is caught as an intruder, but Frodo intercedes to save the creature.
                Gollum leads Frodo and Sam up the mountain called Cirith Ungol and into tunnels inhabited by Shelob, a giant, deadly female spider. Shelob paralyzes Frodo with her sting, but Sam kills the spider. Frodo and Sam are separated, however, as Orc guards find Frodo and proceed to take him off to their headquarters, where they plan to search him for the Ring. Sam believes Frodo to be dead, so he accepts the responsibility of carrying the Ring by himself.
                Surrounded by Orcs, the terrified Sam dons the Ring and finds that it enables him to understand the Orc language. Sam follows the guards who carry off the paralyzed Frodo. Upon hearing them mention that Shelob only devours living creatures, Sam is shocked to realize that his friend is alive. He chastises himself for taking the Ring for himself, unaware that he has actually saved the Ring and kept it from Sauron by taking it from Frodo. Sam realizes that Frodo is alive at the very moment when the guards enter Mordor, slamming the gates in Sam’s face. As The Two Towers ends, Sam is anguished by the thought that he and Frodo are separated.

            <h1 class="modal-h1">Return of the King</h1>
            <p class="modal-p">
                The Return of the King, the third and final volume in The Lord of the Rings, opens as Gandalf and Pippin ride east to the city of Minas Tirith in Gondor, just after parting with King Théoden and the Riders of Rohan at the end of The Two Towers. In Minas Tirith, Gandalf and Pippin meet Denethor, the city’s Steward, or ruler, who clearly dislikes Gandalf. Pippin offers Denethor his sword in service to Gondor, out of gratitude for the fact that Denethor’s son Boromir gave his life for the hobbits earlier in the quest.
                A blanket of gloom—which Gandalf calls the Darkness—begins to issue from Mordor and soon obscures the entire sky over Minas Tirith. Meanwhile, Aragorn realizes that the Riders may not reach the city in time to defend it from the imminent conflict with Mordor. Aragorn parts company with Théoden and decides to take the legendary Paths of the Dead to Gondor. As he travels through the Paths, accompanied by Legolas and Gimli, a huge army of the Sleepless Dead heeds Aragorn’s commands and follows him southward.
                In Gondor, Denethor sends his other son, Faramir, to hold off the approaching armies of Mordor at Osgiliath. Faramir holds his position as long as he can, but he ultimately gives up the field, despite Gandalf’s help. Retreating to the city, a poisoned arrow of the Nazgûl—the Black Riders—strikes Faramir down, though it does not kill him. Later, as the fierce battle wages outside Minas Tirith, Denethor goes mad and locks himself in a crypt with the ailing Faramir. Denethor plans to destroy the remnants of the line of Gondor’s Stewards.
                The army of Mordor nearly breaks through Minas Tirith’s defenses, but the Riders of Rohan arrive just in time to fight the army off. The Lord of the Nazgûl, the Black Captain, kills King Théoden. In heroic defense, Lady Éowyn and Merry slay the Black Captain, though Éowyn is grievously wounded. The forces of Mordor regroup, but Aragorn arrives via the Anduin River on the black ships of the Enemy, which he has conquered with the help of the Dead.
                Pippin finds Gandalf, and together they stop Denethor from killing his son. The old Steward throws himself on a burning pyre and kills himself. Having rescued Gondor, Aragorn enters Minas Tirith and heals those whom the Black Captain wounded during the battle. In so doing, Aragorn fulfills an ancient prophecy concerning the coming of the next king of Gondor.
                The leaders of the armies of the West decide to put together an assault on Mordor in order to distract Sauron from the quest of Frodo, the Ring-bearer. Aragorn’s forces march to the Black Gate of Mordor and confront Sauron’s Lieutenant. The Lieutenant claims that the hobbit spies—Frodo and Sam—have been captured in Mordor. Gandalf rebukes the Lieutenant, who flees inside the Gate and unleashes the great armies of Mordor.
                In the meantime, Sam manages to rescue Frodo from the tower of Cirith Ungol. With the aid of the Ring and his sword, Sam scares off the Orcs he encounters. The hobbits don Orc clothing and begin the arduous trek through Mordor. The Ring grows heavier around Frodo’s neck with each step.
                After several long and weary days of travel, the two hobbits reach Orodruin, or Mount Doom. Sam carries Frodo to the top. Just as they reach the Cracks of Doom, Frodo refuses to give up the Ring, overcome by its power. Gollum appears and struggles with Frodo. Gollum bites the Ring off Frodo’s finger, but then he stumbles and falls into the Cracks of Doom. Sauron’s power breaks, and Aragorn’s forces at the Black Gate defeat the panicked servants of Mordor. Gandalf flies to Orodruin on the back of Gwaihir, the giant eagle, and rescues Frodo and Sam.
                The Darkness dissipates from Gondor. Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor, and he marries Arwen, Elrond’s daughter from Rivendell. Minas Tirith and the surrounding areas begin to recover and rebuild.
                The hobbits return to the Shire, where they find their homes ravaged. A group of Men have entered and set up an oppressive police state. The four companions organize a rebellion and rout the intruders, discovering that the secret leader of the destruction is Saruman, the deposed wizard, who seeks revenge on the hobbits. Frodo spares Saruman’s life, but the wizard’s browbeaten servant, Wormtongue, betrays and kills his cruel master.
                The hobbits rebuild the Shire and return to their ordinary lives. Sam marries a hobbit named Rosie Cotton, and together they have a daughter. Frodo, wounded by the burden of the Ring-quest, decides to leave the Shire. He sails away over the Great Sea with Gandalf, Bilbo, and the other Ring-bearers to the peaceful paradise in the unknown West.

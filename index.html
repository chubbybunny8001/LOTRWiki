            <h1 class="body-h1">Lord of the Rings</h1>
            <p class="body-p">The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. Set in Middle-earth, intended to be Earth at some distant time in the past, the story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's book The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.
                The title refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron, who in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power given to Men, Dwarves, and Elves, in his campaign to conquer all of Middle-earth. From homely beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the quest to destroy the One Ring mainly through the eyes of the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin.</p>

                    <h1>Barad Dur</h1>
                    <p class="popup-text">
                        Barad-dûr was built by Sauron in the land of Mordor, not far from the volcano known as Mount Doom. 
                        The construction of the tower began around the SA 1000, and took six hundred years to complete. 
                        It was the greatest fortress built since the fall of Angband during the War of Wrath. 
                        Barad-dûr was besieged for seven years by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men during the Second Age, 
                        and was leveled after Sauron's defeat at the hands of Isildur. But because it was created using the power of the One Ring, 
                        its foundations could not be destroyed while the Ring itself still existed.
                        As Isildur failed to destroy the Ring, the tower was eventually re-built when 
                        Sauron returned to Mordor thousands of years later in TA 2942.

                        The fortress of the Tower of the Sun was built to guard against the Men of the White Mountains in the year Second Age 3320 by the Dúnedain of Gondor, 
                        those Faithful Númenóreans who escaped the destruction of Númenor the year prior. 
                        It was at that time named Minas Anor, meaning "Tower of the Sun". It served as the home of Anárion, as Minas Ithil, 
                        built to guard against Mordor, became the dwelling-place of Isildur. 
                        The South-kingdom, however, was jointly ruled from Osgiliath by both brothers under the overlordship of Elendil.

                        (The Wizard's Vale) in the Misty Mountains. Its location was at the northwestern corner of the Kingdom of Gondor, 
                        guarding the Fords of Isen from enemy incursions into Calenardhon and, together with the fortress of Aglarond to its south, 
                        protecting the Gap of Rohan.Isengard was comprised of a black, circular, stone-wall surrounding a broad plain, 
                        in the center of which was the Tower of Orthanc. Isengard had only one gate, which faced south.

                        Bree continued to thrive without any central authority or government for many centuries. 
                        Bree had become the most westerly settlement of men in all of Middle-earth by the time of the War of the Ring, and became one of only three or four inhabited settlements in all of Eriador. 
                        At the time of the War of the Ring, Bree-land was the only part of Middle-earth where Men and hobbits dwelt together. Being located on the most important crossroads in the north, 
                        on the crossing of the Great East Road and the Greenway, people would pass through Bree. The Prancing Pony had many rooms, but the local people did not seem accustomed to many travellers.

                        It was built with the power of the One Ring, like the Barad-dûr. 
                        After Sauron's fall in the War of the Last Alliance, it was garrisoned by the Men of Gondor, who raised the two great Towers of the Teeth, Narchost and Carchost, 
                        which were built on either side of the wall and were tall enough to overlook it.

                        However Elrond arrived too late and along with the refugees from Eregion was forced to retreat back to a valley which they made into a stronghold. This was the beginning of Rivendell. 
                        Sauron laid siege to it but with the arrival of the Númenóreans the besieging force was destroyed.
